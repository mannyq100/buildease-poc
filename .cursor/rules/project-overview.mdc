## Project Overview

In developing countries like Ghana, individuals often manage the construction of their homes independently due to limited financial resources. This self-management approach can lead to several challenges:

- Extended project timelines
- Budget overruns
- Difficulties in tracking expenses and materials
- Inefficient resource allocation

To address these challenges, we propose the development of a comprehensive application designed to streamline construction project management for individual builders.
## Project Scope

Buildese aims to solve critical challenges in the construction industry by providing:

1. **Centralized Project Management**: A single source of truth for all project information, eliminating data silos and improving communication across stakeholders.

2. **Intelligent Resource Allocation**: AI-assisted planning tools for optimizing resource allocation including labor, materials, and equipment.

3. **Financial Visibility**: Real-time tracking of expenses, budgets, and financial forecasting to prevent cost overruns.

4. **Schedule Optimization**: Interactive scheduling tools with critical path analysis and dependency management.

5. **Document Control**: Version-controlled document management with approval workflows and compliance tracking.

6. **Quality Assurance**: Inspection checklists, issue tracking, and resolution workflows to maintain quality standards.

7. **Reporting & Analytics**: Customizable dashboards and reports providing actionable insights across all aspects of construction projects.

The current prototype focuses on demonstrating the user interface and core features, with plans to expand functionality and integrate with external systems in future versions.

## Key Features

- **Project Dashboard**: Centralized overview of all projects with key metrics and status indicators
- **Task Management**: Plan, assign, and track tasks throughout the construction lifecycle
- **Team Collaboration**: Manage team members, roles, and responsibilities
- **Schedule Management**: Interactive timeline views for project scheduling
- **Material Tracking**: Inventory management for construction materials
